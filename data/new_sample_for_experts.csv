She's gotten very, frighteningly sick several times since then, and it's been a huge struggle to keep her healthy, and a huge burden financially on both of us with her going in and out of hospitals and having surgery, not to mention the constant pressure of all the appointments for doctors and her home health help visits such as physical therapy and nursing to juggle.

869,I don't know if it would be classed as actual depression but I occasionally have depressive episodes. These often occur late at night when I am on my own and focus on my thoughts too much. I focus on all the elements of myself that I dislike and compare myself to other people. I feel alone and worthless and that I am not good at anything. I feel a weight on my chest and cry a lot.

102,"Over the past 2 weeks my depression has become much worse - more so than at any other time in my life. Because of the lack of opportunities in my local area, which has been made worse due to COVID-19, I have come to the realization that many of my plans and objectives that I had made for the next 12 months are simply unattainable and impossible. For the past 8 years I have had to deal with a profoundly bad form of depression, and this year was meant to mark a change in my life. However, with the national and international COVID-19 situation not getting any better, I don't think my future - when considering COVID-19, local economic opportunities, and my own living and financial situation - has anything that I can look forward to. Combined with the aforementioned issues is my autism, which has basically messed up my entire life, and will likely continue to do so - despite my best efforts, I just can't remove the awful pathologies that are the result of having autism spectrum disorder. I think at some point I will develop the courage to kill myself, but as of right now (and the past 8 years) I'm too scared of death to want to kill myself - despite having such a terrible life, which is quite amusing to me at times. I think my autism may also be one of the main reasons why I haven't been able to do much with my life for the past 8 years - such as getting a job.",

I have spent a lot of time aimlessly browsing while being aware that it was aimless but not caring enough to stop. I have also been thinking about suicide more.,
73,"I definitely wouldn't class myself as depressed. Sometimes I'm slightly unhappy or feel a bit fed up but I wouldn't say I'm concerned by it. Especially during the current circumstances and coronavirus pandemic I think it is ok for people to have their down days. I have lots of fun day to day with my little boy and feel content with my life. Sometimes there are times when I'm frustrated with money related issues or living in a rented property but overall I pick myself up and try to resolve any problems that might cause me upset. I have a perfect loving family, great friends and lots of precious memories so don't feel that I could ever get depressed.",

Something I enjoy like a long walk, catch up with a friend etc. I am very open about how I am feeling with my partner and this really helps.",
695,"I have been moderately depressed over the last two weeks (and seriously depressed over the last four months). I attribute my small level of improvement to treatment that I sought. I sought short-term CBT with my university's mental health service, and when that ended I sought more CBT with the NHS mental health service. My symptoms have a lot to do with my experience as a grad student finishing my PhD. They are exacerbated by the lockdown. I have also experienced symptoms of anxiety, making it difficult for me to sleep and to enjoy leisure activities.",
864,"In the first week I was feeling positive and happy with myself, I felt motivated and was productive. Getting things done made me feel happy as I felt a sense of achievement, this made me feel more energised and content with life. 
In the second week, I was not doing so well. I had some bad news and so that started to trigger a series of negative emotions and attract more bad unfortunate events. I was unwell medically and so this got me down. I then started to feel sorry for myself and unmotivated to do anything. Then because I was less productive and did not really achieve much I felt guilty and frustrated about myself. I started to be full of emotions of self-doubt and suffered with low self-esteem. It felt like everyone and everything was out to get at me.",

I smoke like a chimney and I drink like a fish, probably because I know these are both destructive behaviours. I want to be alone all the time but I also feel so incredibly lonely. I have started hiding how down I feel from my partner because I don't want to keep bringing him down. I cry so often.",
510,"Yes, I have been very depressed over the last two weeks. To be honest, I've been very depressed for almost 7 years, with intermittent periods of relative normality (i.e. cessation of most depressive symptoms). However, most of the the last several years I have met the criteria for Major Depressive Disorder and/or Persistent Depressive Disorder, as well as co-morbid disorders which I'd rather not go into for privacy purposes. Overall, I would rate my depression, on average, to be about 7 out of 10 on any arbitrary day. My symptoms include low motivation, anhedonia, low energy, feeling fatigued throughout the day, recurring memories of negative past events that I cannot move past, a propensity to relieve my depression through a variety of means, and generally feeling like I am not capable of achieving what I believe I can achieve. It has affected my social life, my emotional/mental health, my family, my employment, and pretty much everything else in my life. Within the past few weeks, my depression as skyrocketed and is much worse than normal.",

286,"i believe to have been depressed as the lonliness i have felt has increased within these 2 weeks. my family isn't very big so not having many people around me has been hard. i have also become lazy with not having much to do, i feel like i am wasting my time and it is hard for me to become productive and have a good routine, therefore i have been coming out of bed later than i should, wasting most of my day. exercise has been hard to do as i am gym person, not having that has caused me to slack and caused me to become down. hearing more bad news such as the death toll increasing has also increased my depression as well as having that fear for others lives and my own.",
737,"Yes i have been depressed. I am going through a custody battle for my children.  I have not seen them since march, and anxiety is also something i have suffering from.  Being housebound effectively because of covid has not helped with my depression,",

69,"I have been feeling depressed over the last 2 weeks, I can't seem to get my head clear of negative thoughts.

184,"I don't think I feel completely normal, but I feel alot better than I did last year. by taking Vitamin D supplements, going on walks, and gyms opening up (so I can go gym aswell) I'm slowly feeling alot better lately.

With the current lock down/virus my depression is at an all time high, I didn't like my life before and I sure don't like it now. I fell stuck in the situation of unhappiness,",
707,"I have been clinically diagnosed with depression and anxiety with mildly suicidal thoughts. According to my therapist it was due to recent trauma or problem that I started to experience this. Mostly the aspects of I am not good enough, I have no self-worth, I am a failure, I have been born with unluckiness. I also think it was because of the aspect of the fact that I was not taking care of myself enough.",
767,"I don't think I have been depressed as such. I've been worried and unhappy, but I don't think I'm in a state of depression. I've been focusing on work to keep me busy, and keeping my brain distracted with puzzles and tv, so that I don't overthink too much or spiral into depression.",

I have felt constantly desperate about my anguish because there is no trigger to it and no life event that has been making it worse - it's just something I was always prone to that now seems to be taking over my life and thoughts. 

I have been followed by a psychologist and psychiatrist and have been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder.",

902,You have to be proud of yourself for getting up and out of bed as that’s sometimes all you can achieve. You should praise the small productive steps otherwise it’s a spiral back to the bottom.,
545,"I've been pretty strongly depressed over the past few weeks, not sleeping well and generally plagued with the memories of slights gone past. It's coincided significantly with the increase in anxiety and has left me feeling completely exhausted. My current anti-depressants don't appear to be doing the trick so I'm trying to change that around a bit, but it's a bit difficult as the depressions means actually getting an appointment with the doctor is a bit much for me to handle. I'm a little better than I was at my worse but it's very annoying and painful to deal with.",

642,I was doing better with depression and my meds but recently I have been backsliding. I'm not sure of the exact cause of it but know that the feelings have reemerged.

825,"Although there is lots happening at the moment, I do feel more contented than I have done in a long time. I am able to rest in a good quality house and just about manage to buy food and other bits I need. I am lucky that I have a fantastic team at work who are very supportive and always ready to help out if someone needs a hand.

However, there have been some instances where my mood has become suddenly extremely low. 
After multiple weeks of being clean, I self-harmed again last night. I was sitting on my bathroom floor, crying, convinced that my life was not worth living and that I was a waste of space.
