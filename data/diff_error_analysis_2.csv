518,"Hopefully I've formatted everything correctly so far.

I would say that it's a general numbness and insensitivity to emotions, almost as if I'm a rock that waves of feelings just crash over. There are plenty of situations that I know ought to illict a response from me emotionally, but I truly feel nothing unless it personally impacts me, and even then I'm only concerned for the logistical implications of something bad or good happening.

It's also a feeling of hopelessness alongside the apathy, particularly with regards to feeling overwhelmed by the enormity of expectation upon me (and therefore never being able to live up to that, or never being able to feel ""normal"" in the future, etc.).",12.0,11,18.0,-7.0,20.0,-9.0,-1.0,6.0,8.0,1.0,6.0,8.0
92,"Since 2018 i've experienced severe depressive episodes although i can consider myself to be high functioning - ie I go to work and do my daily tasks normally - but I'm constantly feeling a sense of dread towards my life and my future, snapping at my loved ones and have crying spells nearly every day. 
I have felt constantly desperate about my anguish because there is no trigger to it and no life event that has been making it worse - it's just something I was always prone to that now seems to be taking over my life and thoughts. 

I have been followed by a psychologist and psychiatrist and have been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder.

512,"Yes I would say I have been depressed but it has run parallel to feeling very angry (about both a particular event and an ongoing situation in particular) so it has been more difficult to recognise as depression but certain symptoms have  been happening that I recognise as a sign of depression (crying, feelings of worthlessness, feelings of frustration (& anger), lack of patience with others and a small degree of self harming.) These feelings have been very strong (particularly the anger.)

102,"Over the past 2 weeks my depression has become much worse - more so than at any other time in my life. Because of the lack of opportunities in my local area, which has been made worse due to COVID-19, I have come to the realization that many of my plans and objectives that I had made for the next 12 months are simply unattainable and impossible. For the past 8 years I have had to deal with a profoundly bad form of depression, and this year was meant to mark a change in my life. However, with the national and international COVID-19 situation not getting any better, I don't think my future - when considering COVID-19, local economic opportunities, and my own living and financial situation - has anything that I can look forward to. Combined with the aforementioned issues is my autism, which has basically messed up my entire life, and will likely continue to do so - despite my best efforts, I just can't remove the awful pathologies that are the result of having autism spectrum disorder. I think at some point I will develop the courage to kill myself, but as of right now (and the past 8 years) I'm too scared of death to want to kill myself - despite having such a terrible life, which is quite amusing to me at times. I think my autism may also be one of the main reasons why I haven't been able to do much with my life for the past 8 years - such as getting a job.",24.0,18,12.0,6.0,12.0,6.0,-6.0,-12.0,-12.0,6.0,12.0,12.0
